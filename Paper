Observable Self-Adaptive Complex Recursive Symbolic Networks

Date: January 6, 2026
Version: 31.0 (The Observable Edition)
Topic: Neuro-Symbolic Hybrid Architectures / Interpretability

1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical architecture and capabilities of SACRSN v31, a specialized neural network designed to address the "Black Box" opacity problem in modern deep learning. Unlike standard Transformers or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that operate on static computational graphs with opaque hidden states, SACRSN v31 introduces a fully observable, complex-valued, recursive architecture.

Key innovations include Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) for dynamic reasoning depth, a Differentiable Stack for explicit memory management, and a Graph-Based Vector Quantization (VQ) system that learns an explicit topology of symbols. This architecture allows for the extraction of human-readable logic rules and the real-time detection of topological anomalies (logic violations) within data streams.

2. Problem Statement

Standard sequence modeling architectures face three critical limitations:

Opacity: Hidden states are high-dimensional vectors that are difficult to interpret semantically.

Fixed Computation: Models expend the same amount of compute on trivial tokens as they do on complex logical predicates.

Symbolic Disconnect: Neural networks struggle to maintain strict symbolic consistency or "rules" over long contexts, often leading to hallucinations that violate established internal logic.

SACRSN v31 addresses these issues by enforcing a normative ethical structure—mathematically defined as topological consistency—and utilizing complex numbers to retain phase information alongside magnitude, enriching the representational capacity of the latent space.

3. Technical Solution

The proposed solution is a hybrid Neuro-Symbolic framework named UberCRSN. It merges continuous differentiable learning with discrete symbolic graph theory.

3.1 Complex-Valued Manifold

The core processor operates in the complex plane (
𝐶
C
). Inputs are embedded with both magnitude (
𝑟
r
) and phase (
𝜃
θ
).

Complex Linear Layers: Perform orthogonal transformations in complex space, preserving signal stability.

ModReLU Activation: A modification of ReLU designed for complex numbers, affecting magnitude while preserving phase.

Significance: This allows the model to encode cyclical relationships and "interference" patterns in data that real-valued networks miss.

3.2 Dynamic Recursion (ACT)

The AdaptiveRecursiveCell implements Adaptive Computation Time. Rather than a fixed pass, the cell loops recursively on the same input state.

Halting Probability: A sigmoid gate predicts when the model has "thought" enough about a specific token.

Ponder Cost: The training objective penalizes excessive looping, forcing the model to be efficient.

3.3 Differentiable Memory Structure

To handle hierarchical data (nested logic), the model utilizes a Differentiable Stack.

Operations: The network outputs continuous control signals for PUSH, POP, and NOOP.

Soft Pointer: A continuous pointer mechanism allows backpropagation through stack operations, enabling the model to learn algorithmic memory management via gradient descent.

4. Implementation Details

The architecture is implemented in PyTorch with the following specific modules:

4.1 The Graph Memory (Symbolic VQ)

Instead of a standard lookup table, the latent space is organized as a directed graph.

Codebook: A tensor of complex-valued symbolic prototypes.

Adjacency Matrix: A learnable 
𝑁
×
𝑁
N×N
 matrix tracking the transition probabilities between symbols.

Quantization: The continuous hidden state 
𝑧
z
 is snapped to the nearest discrete symbol in the codebook.

Constraint: The distance calculation is biased by the learned adjacency matrix, encouraging the model to follow valid "paths" in its internal graph.

4.2 The "Ethical" Constraint Module

This module enforces normative behavior within the network. It calculates the Cross-Entropy between the predicted symbol transition and the established graph topology.

Function: If the model jumps from Symbol A to Symbol B, but the Adjacency Matrix says A 
→
→
 B is impossible, a high "Ethical Loss" is generated.

Result: This forces the model to adhere to its own learned logic, reducing hallucinations.

4.3 Loss Landscape

The model is trained on a compound loss function designed to balance accuracy with structural integrity:

Diversity Weight: Prevents "codebook collapse" (where the model uses only a few symbols) by forcing high entropy in the codebook usage distribution.

Entropy Force: Encourages confident predictions.

5. Observability and Diagnostics

SACRSN v31 includes a visualization suite that renders the internal state of the "Black Box" readable:

Semantic Topology: Extracts the adjacency matrix to draw a NetworkX graph, showing exactly how the model links concepts (e.g., "Truth" 
→
→
 "Perfection").

Stack MRI: visualizes the depth of the differentiable stack over time, allowing engineers to see if the model is "nesting" information.

Phase Plot: Plots the trajectory of the complex-valued hidden states (

 vs

), revealing distinct orbital patterns for different semantic clusters.

Anomaly Detection: By monitoring the "Ethical Loss" during inference, the model acts as a detector. If an input violates the learned topology (e.g., "True without falsehood certain and most banana"), the internal topological violation score spikes, flagging the anomaly immediately.

6. Conclusion

SACRSN v31 represents a shift from purely statistical correlation engines toward observable, reasoning-capable architectures. By explicitly modeling state transitions via a graph and utilizing a differentiable stack, the system provides transparency and logical robustness not present in standard neural architectures. The integration of complex-valued weights further enhances the stability and expressiveness of the representation space.
